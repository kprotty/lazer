Imagine Elixir, but over-engineered and focused on memory usage. It should be safe to say that this is more of a research project than a solution to a practical problem therefore it should not be used in production. Heavily inspired by Erlang BEAM as well as Ponylang.

## Compiling
```
cargo build --release
```
